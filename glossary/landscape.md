**Landscape** is basic social networking software for Urbit. Landscape is a user-facing messaging app built using [Gall](../gall). Similar to [Talk](../talk), Landscape has a web interface that can be accessed with a browser via [ship.arvo.network](../shiparvonetwork), ```localhost:80```, or with an iOS app.

Landscape allows you to participate in IRC-like chats such as ```~dopzod/urbit-help```, subscribe to forum-like pages of other ships called Notebooks, and message other ships directly.

Landscape is at frontend for the messaging protocol [Chat](../chat).
