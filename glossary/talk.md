**Talk** was Urbit's first big user-facing application. Talk utilized the [Hall](../hall) backend to ferry messages between ships, and acted as the frontend for the users to chat. This included reading from and writing to circles, as well as managing them. Talk is no longer used, and has been superseded by [Chat](../chat).
