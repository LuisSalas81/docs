The **Dojo** is Urbit's command-line application that processes system commands and returns output. It also runs [Hoon](../hoon) and [Nock](../nock) code, making it a good place to play around with those languages.

The other default command-line app is [Chat](../chat). To switch between Dojo and [Chat](../chat). The Dojo is the first thing you encounter after successfully booting your [ship](../ship).
