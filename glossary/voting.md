**Voting** is a power available to [galaxies](../galaxy), in their capacities as members of the [Galactic Senate](../senate), through an [Azimuth](../azimuth) smart contract. Galaxies collectively make decisions about the governance of Azimuth and the [Arvo](../arvo) network by voting. There are two types of votes: a [constitution vote](../constitutionvote) and a [document vote](../docvote).
